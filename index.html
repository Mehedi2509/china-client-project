              An appliance wire harness is a group of wires bundled together to
              connect different parts inside home or industrial appliances.
              These wires help send electricity and signals so that the
              appliance can work properly. Instead of running many loose wires,
              the harness keeps them organized, safe, and easy to install.
              You’ll often find wire harnesses in washing machines,
              refrigerators, ovens, and other machines we use every day.
